### What I learned

Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of several key concepts in web development. One of the major takeaways was the importance of efficient state management in React. Using the Context API to manage job listings and filters helped me understand how to share state across multiple components without excessive prop drilling.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my React performance optimization skills by mastering techniques like React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to build more efficient applications. I also aim to deepen my understanding of state management using Redux and Context API while refining my TypeScript skills for better type safety and scalability. Additionally, I plan to gain more experience in backend integration, working with databases, APIs, and authentication to build full-stack applications. Advancing my GSAP animation techniques, improving my testing practices with Jest and React Testing Library, and developing scalable, reusable UI components are also key areas I want to refine. By continuously improving these skills, I aim to build more efficient, maintainable, and high-quality web applications
